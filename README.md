Implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Algorithms: Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm and Gibbs Sampling

While learning about MCMC algorithms, I decided to code up and replicate some results to internalize my learning. All examples and ideas are referenced from the papers/blogs in the references below. If you find any typos or mistakes in my code, please let me know! I hope that this code will be useful for others who are also trying to learn about MCMC algorithms!
